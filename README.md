# Extract and Deploy process models from Web Modeler
## Background
Web Modeler does not currently have support for the extraction and deployment of resources (i.e., BPMN, DMN and Forms)
to different CI / CD platforms such as GitLab, GitHub and Bitbucket â€” the user must manage this through the [WM API](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/web-modeler-api/overview/).
The Web Modeler currently only has
* An option to deploy models directly to a Zeebe cluster (subject to the user having the right roles assigned)
* A native GitHub integration to allow users to synch the models to a repository (again, subject to the user having the right roles assigned)

## Solution
This project provides solutions to:
* Extract models from Web Modeler using the Web Modeler API, and
* Update a git repo with the extracted model
* Deploy a tagged version of the model to a target Zeebe cluster (environment)

To facilitate that, a Docker image is provided that is capable of 
those operations and is suited for use in a DevOps pipeline. 
The operations work with any CI/CD platform and have so far been tested with:
* [GitLab](./GitLab.md)
* [Github](./Github.md)
* [Bitbucket](./BitBucket.md)

Use the links above to understand how to integrate the extract and deploy operations into your
DevOps pipelines.

# Running the Docker container
The container can be run in the following modes, as described below:

## Extract
To extract process models from a Web Modeler project and commit to a local git repository:

For SaaS environments:
```shell
docker run -it --rm \
    --mount type=bind,src=${PWD},dst=/local --workdir /local \
      -e OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="<Client Id>" \
      -e OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="<Client secret>" \
      -e CAMUNDA_WM_PROJECT="<The WM project to extract from>" \
      -e GIT_USERNAME="<Git Username>" \
      -e GIT_USER_EMAIL="<Git Email address>" \
      -e SKIP_CI="<Indicate (\"true\" | \"false\") if you want to run any pipelines or not on the commit>" \

# Web Modeler project configuration

We support a couple of methods of specifying which Web Modeler project to interact with, either via the `CAMUNDA_WM_PROJECT` environment variable, or by providing a configuration file in the working directory/repository.

The configuration file can be either YAML or JSON and by default we will look for a file named `config.[yml|yaml|json]` in the working directory. If you wish to use an alternate name, then this can be specified in the `WM_PROJECT_METADATA_FILE` environment variable. If a config file is not detected, then one will be created after the first successful execution. 

The config file should contain a project element with a child id element where the value is the id of the project in Web Modeler (the guid in the URL when accessing the project), and optionally a name property.

e.g. in YAML:
```yaml
project:
  id: 571c8e5d-dcdf-41b5-bb42-e5f3ae593db9
  name: Connector Templates
```

# Using a local Zeebe docker stack for development
## Docker and hostnames
If you are running the extract/deploy app on the same host as the Zeebe docker stack (i.e. on a developer's computer)
you need to make some changes to the Docker compose file for the Zeebe stack in order for the authentication to work
between the local containers, or your will get `An error occurred while attempting to decode the Jwt: The iss claim is not valid`

Assuming that you are using the docker compose files from [this repo](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform); In the directory with the Camunda 8
docker-compose file you should edit the `.env` file and change the `HOST` variable from `localhost` to your hosts IP address.

The Web Modeler docker compose does not use these environment variables, so we need to update them individually.
Open the `docker-compose-web-modeler.yaml` file in a text editor and update the following environment
variable lines, replacing `localhost` in the URLs with `${HOST}` while leaving the port number intact:

- RESTAPI_OAUTH2_TOKEN_ISSUER
- RESTAPI_SERVER_URL
- SERVER_URL
- OAUTH2_TOKEN_ISSUER

Save the changes and then create the docker container as usual. You will need to use your IP address rather than
`localhost` when accessing any of the exposed services (i.e. Operate, Web Modeler etc.) but otherwise they should function as normal.

## Authentication setup

### Extraction from and Connector Template Deployment to Web Modeler
You need to create a client app and secret for the extract-deploy app to use for accessing Web Modeler.
1. Open Identity in your browser https://localhost:8084 and log in.
2. Click **Add Application**, enter a name, like `wm-extract-deploy` (use this as the Client ID), select the **M2M** radio button, and click **Add**.
3. Click on the new Application you created and make a note of the Client Secret as you will need this for the extract script.
4. Open the **Access to APIs** tab, click the **Assign Permissions** button and then select **Web Modeler API** from the dropdown. Select the read, write, and create permission checkboxes and then click the **Add** button.

### Deployment to Zeebe
You can use the standard client id: `zeebe` and client secret: `zecret`, or add 

## Building locally

`docker build -t bp3global/wm-extract-deploy .`
